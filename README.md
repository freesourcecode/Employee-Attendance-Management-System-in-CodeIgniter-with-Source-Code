# Employee Attendance Management System in CodeIgniter with Source Code

The **Employee Attendance Management System in CodeIgniter** is primarily concerned with managing personnel records and attendance.

The system is a company’s way of keeping track of employees’ time and attendance.

An accurate attendance and time-tracking system saves you time and effort when figuring out how long your employees have worked.

In addition, the system displays all available information, such as the employee’s full name, contact information, address, and date of hire.

Only an Admin Panel is included in the project.

To summarize this web app, the admin can add and manage employees, including their name, date of birth, contact information, and date of joining, as well as determine whether they are currently active or not.

To elaborate on the project, the admin must track each employee’s attendance by selecting whether he or she is present, absent, or on vacation from a drop-down menu.

The same applies to attendance each and every month.
